# Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon @ Rabat, Morocco 2022
We are extremely excited to hold the Qiskit Fall Fest Hackathon in Morocco! It's open to everyone in Morocco or French-speaking In university Mohammed 5 agdal.

It's a unique opportunity to get to know about Quantum Computing, coding with Qiskit (a quantum toolkit developed by IBM), and finish some cool projects together!

# Challenges
We are preparing some cool projects and they will be released soon! Of course, you are encouraged to create your own project! Any topics relevant to quantum computing are accepted. Note that, the utilization of Qiskit is obligatory.

Here are some possible ideas:

Quantum game design, Paper implementation, Quantum Machine Learning, etc.

# Hackathon Schedule
All times are in the Paris time zone (CET).

Please fill in this Google Form for registration. You are welcome to register as a team (don't forget to mention it in the sheet!). For individual participant, don't worry, we will make sure that every team has four members!

All the participants will be invited to a Discord channel before the Hackathon.

Speakers
William D. Oliver( MIT ) talk is going to be about Engineering superconducting Qubit
Pawel Gora ( Quantum AI Foundation) talk is going to be an Introduction to Quantum machine learning
Marlou Slot (NIST: National Institute of standards and technology ) talk is going to be about Womium program
Abdallah Slaoui : Quantum Information

Important notes
You are welcome to participate to our kick-off event physically on Tuesday afternoon 27th of October, at around 1 PM. We will announce the address once it's confirmed.
We will hold three Qiskit workshops before the hackathon. The first one is to help you install Qiskit and introduce the basis knowledge about quantum computing. It will last two hours. The second one is two hours fully Q&A session and then the the third is about 3h QML. You are welcome to ask any questions. The two workshops will be recorded so don't worry that you miss one of them! If you are a beginner in Quantum Computing or not familiar with Qiskit, just attend the Qiskit workshops!
The winning teams will obtain prizes and have the probability to be invited to the Qiskit Global Hackathon!
